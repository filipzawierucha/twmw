Why we use everywhere winapi bool to our own function we need to change that but i'm to fucking lazy - i dont know i dont want to change that too so shut the fuck up

have you seen longer spaghetti code than GetAllActiveWindows() function in winutils? idk but it works so shut up. 

tried to do hook for WM_GETMINMAXINFO to ensure all apps would be resized - the one with size limiters too. But it seems not working cuz im suck and cgpt dont know how to do it properly.

there is a problem where border is calculated wrong and the apps seems to overlap a little bit.
